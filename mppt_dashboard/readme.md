## mppt_dashboard Application

![mppt_dashboard](mppt_dashboard.png)

This directory contains the mppt_dashboard xojo project, built binaries for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, and a user manual.  [Xojo](https://www.xojo.com) is a commercial cross-platform development tool I use for rapid application development.  It requires a license in order to spit out compiled binaries but it has a demo mode that allows you to build and run an application from within the IDE without a license.
